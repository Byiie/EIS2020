# FAQ 
* Q:How can we change the pattern of the roof?   
  * A:Open .csv file,use 1 or 0 to design the roof.Then read .csv and judge the number in python(0 can be air,1 can be block)so that the roof can be print into minecraft.
     Besides,more numbers can be used to design the roof.(like 2 3 4 5 etc.)Just code in python to judge these numbers and make the roof more elaborate.
